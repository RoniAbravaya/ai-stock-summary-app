## Redesign (feature-flag)

The app includes a gated redesign that can be turned on per-device without affecting existing functionality.

- **Enable in app**: Open the Settings/Profile screen and toggle "Use new design". The choice is saved locally and persists across restarts.
- **What changes when enabled**:
  - Global theme using Inter typography, updated colors and shapes
  - Pill-shaped BottomNavigationBar with SafeArea padding and subtle blur (BackdropFilter) on scroll
  - Redesigned screens: News list, Stocks list, Stock Details (header + actions), Notification Settings, Notification History, Language Settings
  - Legacy UI is preserved when the toggle is OFF
- **Under the hood**:
  - Managed by `FeatureFlagService` with SharedPreferences key `feature_redesign_enabled`
  - Reactive switching via a stream surrounding `MaterialApp`
- **Programmatic toggle (for developers)**:
  - Set at runtime: `await FeatureFlagService().setRedesignEnabled(true);`
  - Or set the SharedPreferences key `feature_redesign_enabled = true`
- **Rollback**:
  - The redesign is fully gated by the toggle; disabling it restores legacy UI.
  - All changes are on branch `feature/redesign-flag-toggle` to allow safe rollback via Git if needed.
